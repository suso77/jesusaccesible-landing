    -   Bilingual support (Spanish: , English: ).
    -   Contact form that sends submissions to .
    -   A button to download the CV.
-   **Core Requirement (Non-negotiable):** Strict adherence to WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 Level A & AA accessibility standards. This includes:
    -   High contrast ratios (including on hover/focus states).
    -   Fully navigable via keyboard.
    -   Visible focus indicators.

**User's preferred language**:
The user's primary language is **Spanish (es)**. You MUST continue the conversation in Spanish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The frontend is a multi-lingual portfolio website built with TailwindCSS and numerous accessibility features. The backend provides two main APIs: one to handle contact form submissions via SMTP (which is fully configured and tested) and another to serve a PDF file of the user's CV for download. All content is currently hardcoded in a mock data file.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was performing a comprehensive accessibility enhancement for screen readers. This involved adding descriptive  attributes to interactive elements (links, buttons) across all major components (, , , , ) to provide better context for visually impaired users.
*   **Status:** **BLOCKED**
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
*   **User Testing Done:** Y (The user reported the entire website is now broken).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** The entire website is non-functional after the last set of accessibility changes. **(Priority: P0 - CRITICAL)**

**Issues Detail:**
*   **Issue 1: Website is not working**
    *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent checked server-side logs, which showed the frontend server was running without compilation errors. This was insufficient as the issue is a client-side runtime error.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  The primary suspect is a JavaScript syntax error introduced during the last batch of edits.
        2.  Use the  tool immediately. The browser console log captured with the screenshot will pinpoint the exact file and line number causing the crash.
        3.  Inspect the file indicated in the error log. Look for syntax errors such as a missing bracket , an unclosed template literal , or incorrect usage of variables within the newly added  attributes. The files edited right before the crash were: , , , , and .
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The application is currently unusable. Fixing this will restore functionality and allow for further development.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None. This is the blocker.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks in progress, as the current focus is on fixing the critical bug.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **(P1) SEO Implementation:** Generate , , and implement  structured data as per the original request.
    *   **(P2) Advanced Accessibility Verification:** After fixing the site, perform a full manual test run:
        *   Navigate the entire site using only the keyboard.
        *   Test the user journey with a screen reader (e.g., VoiceOver/NVDA).
        *   Verify the layout does not break when zoomed to 200% and 400%.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   Implement an FAQ section.
    *   Add a Schedule a consultation feature, potentially integrating a tool like Calendly.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack Application:** Developed a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Bilingual Support:** Implemented language switching (ES/EN) using React Context.
- **Backend Services:** Created and tested endpoints for CV download () and email submission via SMTP ().
- **Multiple UI & Accessibility Iterations:**
  - Implemented a professional, minimalist design with a consistent style for all sections.
  - Achieved WCAG AA/AAA contrast compliance for text, links, and buttons in all states (default, hover, focus).
  - Ensured visible focus outlines and proper focus management (e.g., mobile menu, CTA-to-form).
  - Fixed responsive bugs, such as hiding the hamburger menu on desktop.
  - Resolved an issue where Google Translate was incorrectly translating the JFA logo.
  - Added a Navigation section to the footer and refined the layout.
  - Implemented descriptive s for screen readers (this was the last action that broke the site).
- **Content Updates:** Added new skills and certifications as requested by the user.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The agent has been diligent in addressing all previously raised user issues.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Hooks, , TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI,  for asynchronous email.
-   **Accessibility (a11y):** WCAG 2.1/2.2 (A/AA), ARIA, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus management.
-   **Internationalization (i18n):** Bilingual support managed via React Context.

**key DB schema**
-   The default  collection in MongoDB exists but is not used for the portfolio's core functionality.

**changes in tech stack**
-    was added to the backend to facilitate sending emails.

**All files of reference**
-   **Core Logic:** , 
-   **Content:** 
-   **Styling:** , 
-   **Backend:** , 
-   **Recently Modified (Potential source of error):** , , , , 

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The single  file is becoming large and difficult to manage. It would be better to split translations into separate JSON files (e.g., , ).

**key api endpoints**
-   : Submits the contact form and sends an email.
-   : Serves the user's CV as a downloadable PDF.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The application is currently broken.** Your first priority is to diagnose and fix the crash that occurred after the last set of accessibility changes. The user is an accessibility expert with very high standards, so do not compromise on quality.
-   **Debugging Strategy:** The crash is client-side. Use the  tool to get the browser's console log. This is the fastest way to find the error.
-   **User Language:** You must communicate with the user in **Spanish**.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   And several other markdown files documenting previous changes.
